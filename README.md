# ecom delivery accelerator

We were tasked to look at different sets of e-commerce tools to see which products work well together.

Some of the tech we looked into:

- commercetools (products, prices, images)
- contentful (cms)
- storyblok (cms)
- vue storefront (the shop)
- algolia (search)

Tech we looked into but got shut down because the docs weren't clear/ or general tech issues:

- akeneo
- elasticpath

Tech we looked into and made some progress:

- okta
- instant search

Tech we picked up, then threw out the window:

- builder.io
- react storefront
